The growing sophistication of cyber threats also calls for the increased vigilance and capability of financial institutions to respond to emerging threats. Critically, this should ensure the continuous availability of essential financial services to customers and adequate protection of customer data.\n\n1.3 This policy document sets out the Bank\u2019s requirements with regard to financial institutions\u2019 management of technology risk. In complying with these requirements, a financial institution shall have regard to the size and complexity of its operations. Accordingly, larger and more complex financial institutions are expected to demonstrate risk management practices and controls that are commensurate with the increased technology risk exposure of the institution. In addition, all financial institutions shall observe minimum prescribed standards in this policy document to prevent the exploitation of weak links in interconnected networks and systems that may cause detriment to other financial institutions and the wider financial system.

This appendix is mentioned as a guide for sound practices in defined areas, along with Appendices 1 to 5. This addition suggests that there are now more specific guidelines and control measures for financial institutions to follow in managing technology risk. Additionally, the new text emphasizes the importance of financial institutions being prepared to explain alternative risk management practices that depart from the control measures outlined in the appendices and demonstrate their effectiveness in addressing technology risk exposure.
